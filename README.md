# HL2-APManual
A project to add Archipelago Manual support for Half-Life 2 and it's episodes in one convenient apworld

# !! Before You Start !!

!! Please note that this is an AP Manual implementation,not a fullfledged AP implementation. PLEASE be knowledgeable of the Half-Life Dev Console before install !!

# What You Will Need:

- The Latest Archipelago Version (available here: https://archipelago.gg/tutorial/Archipelago/setup/en )

- The Latest Version Of The AP Manual Client (https://github.com/ManualForArchipelago/Manual)

- UniversalTracker (Available in AP Manual Discord)

- Half-Life 2 and it's episodes on Steam

# Items are:

- Chapters

- Weapons

Weapons will be divided on a per-game basis, meaning that players will have to effectively weave between the games according to what weapon checks they end up getting. 

# Checks are:

- Major story events

- Health and armor stations

- Lambda Caches

- Radar Caches

- Achievements (Achievesanity only)

- G-Man Sightings (G-Manity only)

# Goals:

- Defeat Dr. Breen (Finish Dark Energy)

- Escape City 17 (Finish Exit 17)

- Launch The Rocket (Finish T-Minus One)

# Things I want to experiment with in this manual:

- Settings so that players can choose to only play one of the games on offer

This is so that Half-Life fans aren't forced into playing all three games on one slot when they might only want to player a shorter game like one of the episodes during a sync game

- Achievesanity

Half-Life 2 and it's episodes have some very interesting achievements that require the player to explore niche parts of the map or play through certain parts of the game in a certain way, such as playing through the chapter "We Don't Go To Ravenholm..." using only the Gravity Gun, or even playing through Episode 1 only firing a single bullet! Achievesanity would add these as checks, but I want it to be a setting. While it does add in a lot of potential challenge, it's not something I want to force on people.

- G-Manity

This would add the G-Man sightings as checks. These are sprinkled throughout HL2 and EP2, and adding them in is a good way to test for player knowledge and just as a goofy way of adding in more checks. Again, like Achievesanity I'd like to make this a setting instead
